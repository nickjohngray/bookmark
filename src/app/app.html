<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Router Outlet

     Purpose:
     - Acts as a placeholder for rendering the component associated with the
       current active route.
     - Angular's Router replaces this tag with the template of the component
       that matches the current URL.

     How it works:
     - When the user navigates to `/` (root), the `OverviewPage` component
       is injected here.
     - When the user navigates to `/thank-you`, the `ThankYouPage` component
       (lazy-loaded) is injected here.
     - Switching routes automatically swaps the displayed component without
       reloading the page, enabling SPA (Single Page Application) behavior.

     Notes:
     - You only need one `<router-outlet>` in the root template unless you
       have named or nested outlets for advanced layouts.
